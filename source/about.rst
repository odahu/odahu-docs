About Open Data Analytics Hub (ODAHU)
===========

The ODAHU project is focused on creating system of services, extensions for third party systems and tools which help to accelerate building enterprise level systems with automated AI/ML models life cycle.

**Multi ML Frameworks**
  - Supporting major ML frameworks: Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, H2O (and more)
  - Extends MLflow platform with enterprise level features
**Multi Infrastructure**
  - Kubernetes native system of services
  - Deployment automation to Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts
  - Supporting major Kubernetes platforms: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, RedHat OpenShift
**Secure**
  - Single sign-on (SSO) based on OAuth2
  - RESTful API secured with SSL
  - Role based access control
  - Users activity audit
  - Credentials and keys manager based on HashiCorp Vault
  - Internal traffic encryption with Istio
**Modular and Extensible**
  - Services for different ML phases: transform, train, package, deploy, evaluate
  - Services are extensible and manageable via REST APIs, SDK and CLI
  - Functionality can be extended with new services
  - Connectors for data sources
  - Connectors for package repositories
  - Connectors for Docker container registries
  - Plugins for data science IDEs
  - Plugins for workflow engines (like Airflow and others)
**Scalable**
  - Systems based on ODAHU can be scaled from small to very large.
  - Scalable ML model training phase
  - Scalable ML model serving phase
**Manageable**
  - Pre-build monitoring dashboards
  - Configurable alerting rules
  - Configurable logs collection
  - Compatible with third party logs processing system
**Open**
  - It is free and open-source with the Apache2 License.
